    <h2>Kapil Gupta and the Concept of 'Prescriptions'</h2>
    <h3>9/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        I recently stumbled on<a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com">Kapil Gupta's</a> philosophical works, and something about them resonated with me. An important (perhaps the most important) part of his philosophy has to do with the dangers of what he calls 'prescriptions.' 
        Prescriptions are glib solutions to a particular problem in your life. The can come from the internet, or your parents, or something you may even come up with yourself. Some examples include 'work-hard' or 'get your masters degree' 
        or 'network with people.' Prescriptions - although they have some truth to them - are dangerous because they can lead to a wasted life. 
        And I think we are all slaves to them to some degree. The person that thinks they needs to grind away in their 20's before they can enjoy life or the person that thinks they need to work at a company for a certain amount of years to not be seen as a job-hopper are all following prescriptions.
        Anytime you think you 'have to' do something, it is prescription. Nothing has to be done at anytime other than breathe. Admittedly, this is easy for me to say because I don't have kids or any 
        responsibilities or financial troubles and I am cetainly thankful for all of this, but I think the previous statement is still be true regardless, although it may be much harder pill to swallow depending on your life circumstance.

        When I thought about the concept of prescriptions more, I realized I have been following them my whole life. 
        What is the biggest prescription of them all? I think it is the classic "go to school for 18 years, go to higher education, get a job, marry, work a job until age 65, retire." 
        You certainly can live this way - it doesn't break the laws of physics to live this way. But if you solely rely guides to life like this, it will not live to a fruitful life. It's because you are not following your genuine desires.
        And it's because the truth requires personal effort. You have to struggle. You have to fail. You have to try things out. You only do things because of innate curiosity and genuine desire. 
        It's really hard to do this only becuase the pressure to conform to society is insane. We also seem to have an inner biological tendency to avoid going against the grain of other people's wishes. We also may feel ashamed about following our curiosities.

       We have this notion that you need to 'work-hard' or keep pushing yourself or to do things even when you don't feel like it. 
       I would like to take the completely opposite view. No 'force' is needed in life. 
       I feel we judge ourselves so much. We judge outselves for procrastinating and for not focusing on a task we want to focus on.
       So I am going to see what happens if I just let go and surrendered. What does this mean practiclaly? I am going to be very critical
       about the throughts that run through my head and ask myself if they are really true. I am going to try to make sure every second of my day is being used fruitfully, based 
       on my best understanding of the universe available to me at the time. I won't be critical for myself for wanting to take a break or focusing on something other than what my ego 
       previously decided I should focus on.

        I'll report back in 10 years.
