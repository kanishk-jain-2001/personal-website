    <h2>Kapil Gupta and the Concept of 'Prescriptions'</h2>
    <h3>9/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        Part of me feels bad for writing this since I am only 23 and I haven't accrued enough life experience to be philosophical.
        But, I don't that doesn't mean that all philosophical thoughts I have are automatically wrong.
        This topic has captivated me, and I plan on putting my skin in the game and try to see over the next 5-10 years if it is true.
        This has to do with <a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com">Kapil Gupta's</a> ideas about what he calls 'prescriptions.'
    </p>
    <p>
        Prescriptions are hard to define, but they are glib solutions to a problem in your life given to you by an external source, whether that be Twitter, advice from 
        your elders, or something you may even come up with yourself. Some examples include 'work-hard' or 'get your masters degree.' Presciptions - although they can be 
        good starting points to pursue something, are dangerous. And I think we are all slaves to them. The person that thinks he needs to grind away in his 20's before he can enjoy life. 
        Anytime you think you 'have to' do something, it is probably prescription. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Look, I am no where near successful and I hesitate at all to write this, but something about this idea has rung through with me. 
        I think it has been becasue I have been looking for prescriptions my whole life. 
        What is the biggest prescription of them all? I think it is the classic "go to school for 18 years, go to higher education, get a job, marry, work a job until age 65, retire." 
        I think people are slowly starting to wake up and realize that life is not meant to be lived in this way. 
        Look there is nothing 'bad' about it; if your life has been lived that way, then it has been lived that way. 
        Prescriptions can be starting points, school can be great place to start. Your first job can be a great place to start. 
        But if you want to squeeze the essence out of your life and life the best life possible, I don't think you can solely rely on them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I think every human being can be great. But the way you get there is not by following a prescription. It's by listening to yourself. Truth is something no one can impart on you. You have to follow your gut. You have to make 
        mistakes. There seems to be no other way. Trial and error. 
        It's really hard to do this only becuase the pressure to conform to society is insane. We also seem to have an inner biological tendency to avoid
        going against the grain of other people's wishes. We also may feel ashamed about following our curiosities. 
    </p>
    <p>
       We have this notion that you need to 'work-hard' or keep pushing yourself or to do things even when you don't feel like it. 
       I would like to take the completely opposite view. No 'force' is needed. 
       I feel we judge ourselves so much. We judge outselves for procrastinating and for not focusing. 
       I am going to see what happens if I just let go and surrendered. What does this mean practiclaly? I am going to be very critical
       about the throughts that run through my head and ask myself if they are really true.  
       I'll report back in 5 - 10 years.
