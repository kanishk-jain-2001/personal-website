    <h2>'Prescriptions': Connection Between David Deutsch and Kapil Gupta</h2>
    <h3>9/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        The pandemic was the first time when I had the time to wonder what a good life meant for me, and I looked towards the internet for guidance. 
        This is how I stumbled upon Gary Varynerchuck and Naval Ravikant, and I became a twitter addict. 
        Consuming their content helped change the software in my brain - I have now become a more positive sum thinker. 
        No matter how much I searched, no matter how much content I consumed, I couldn't find 'final' answer to a well lived life. 
        I eventually stumbled upon Kapil Gupta and David Deutsch's works.

        When I first read <a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com">Kapil Gupta's</a> philosophy, I couldn't understand what he was saying. He just sounded unneededly esoteric. 
        I decided to revisit his writings recently, and now I think his theory about what he calls 'prescriptions' puts light into the question of how to live a good life.
        And the answer is that there is no "How to" for that. Prescriptions - which are How To's - are well intentioned but they don't work. They only work in a narrow sense. For example, a doctor prescribing you 
        antibiotics for lyme disease is going to work to treat the lyme disease. But after the disease is cured, you are going to ask 'what now?'
        Unfortunately, prescriptions are everywhere and people just hop from prescription to prescription. 
        Some examples include 'work-hard', 'get a degree', 'network with people.' It could even be Naval's 'How to get rich' tweet storm. 
        Prescriptions are dangerous because they can lead to fixate on them without asking 'why?' Following prescriptions are not even fun. Who likes to follow instructions?
        By fun, I don't just mean partying or chatting up girls, I mean something more nuanced, something that has to do with following your interests and doing work you are meant to do. 
        I just don't think Gary V, Naval, or David Deutsch were forcing themselves to follow some prescription. 
        All the truly successful people seem to be following their unique interests and not following any 'how to's.'

        I was following the classic "go to school for 18 years, go to higher education, and get a nice paying stable job" prescription.   
        You certainly can live this way - it doesn't break the laws of physics to live this way. But by taking this life path for granted, I felt something was missing in my life. 
        In the back of my head, I was thinking, "why am I doing this?" and "is this the only way to live?" I realized the prescription was replacing my genuine desires and curiosities. Since the pandemic, I started to question everything which has lead me down the paths of entrepreneurship, philosophy, science, and even understanding sexual energy. 
        I just wanted to understand for myself how everything works. I feel like my life has been slowly improving since I started to take no ones word for it, i.e. following prescriptions. 
        It has been really hard to do this only because there is social pressure to conform and avoid pursuing the truth.

        Another way to put the idea of prescriptions is that a following a prescription is an 'outward to inward' way to live live. It doesn't work. Life should be lived in an 'inner to outer' way by following your genuine desires. 
        How does this work in practice? I think it has to do with having free time and being alone and thinking. I am wary to write that because it sounds like a prescription. But I think that you should figure everything out 
        for your own. Take no ones word for it.

        Looking forward to testing this theory in my life. I will check back in 10 years.

    <p><strong>TLDR: If you are wondering how to live a good life, you must figure it out on your own through trial and error. The more you fail early the better off you will be later.</strong></p>
