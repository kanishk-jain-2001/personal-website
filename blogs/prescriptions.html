    <h2>'Prescriptions': A connection Between David Deutsch and Kapil Gupta</h2>
    <h3>9/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        When I first read <a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com">Kapil Gupta's</a> philosophy, I couldn't understand what he was saying. He just sounded unnecessarily esoteric. 
        I decided to revisit his writings recently, and now I think his theory about what he calls 'prescriptions' puts light into the question of how to achieve success in life. 
        And the answer is that there is no "How to" for that. Prescriptions - which can be thought of as "How To's" - are well intentioned but they don't work. 
        They only work in a narrow sense. For example, a doctor prescribing you antibiotics for lyme disease is going to work to treat the lyme disease. But after the disease is cured, you are going to ask 'what now?'
        Prescriptions are too glib and they don't capture the full truth. 
        Unfortunately, prescriptions are everywhere and it;s easy to just hop from prescription to prescription in life, living a shallow existence. 
        Some examples include 'work-hard', 'get a degree', 'network with people.' It could even be Naval's 'How to get rich' tweet storm. 
        Prescriptions are dangerous because they can lead to fixate on them without understanding the 'why?' 
        Following prescriptions are not even fun. Who likes to follow instructions? Will talk more about this in the last paragraph.

        I was following the classic "go to school for 18 years, go to higher education, and get into medical school" prescription that is often prescribed to first generation immigrants like myself.  
        You certainly can live this way - it doesn't break the laws of physics to live this way. But by taking this life path for granted, I felt something was missing in my life. 
        In the back of my head, I was thinking, "why am I doing this?" and "is this the only way to live?" I realized the prescription was replacing my genuine desires and curiosities. 
        Since the pandemic, I started to question everything which has lead me down the paths of entrepreneurship, philosophy, science, and even understanding sexual energy. 
        I just wanted to understand for myself how everything works. I feel like my life has been slowly improving since I started to take no ones word for it, i.e. following prescriptions. 
        It has been really hard to do this only because there is social pressure to conform and avoid pursuing the truth.  
        Another way to put the idea of prescriptions is that a following a prescription is an 'outward to inward' way to live live. 
        How does not follow prescriptions?
        If I could explain it clearly, then that would become a new prescription which would defeat the purpose.
        Instead, I think it has to do with flow and understanding yourself. I guess it has to do with the word 'self-awareness.'
        I also seem to find my self-awareness improving after trial and error, periods of suffering, and a lot of time alone.

        Okay, so don't follow prescriptions. But that is also a prescription, so don't - don't follow prescriptions. What does this have to do with David Duetsch? 
        Well, Deutsch talks about something called the 'fun criteron,' which states
        that the there are some things that just feel fun.
        By fun, I don't just mean partying or talking to girls, I mean something more nuanced, something that has to do with following your interests and doing work you are meant to do. 
        I think most of our lives are spent following prescriptions and then revenge procrasinating on the weeknights and weekends. 
        The fun criterion is the solution to this. 
        I just don't believe that the successful people in society - Elon Musk, Tom Brady, Joe Rogan -  force themselves to follow some prescription. 
        All the truly successful people seem to be following their unique interests and not following any 'how to's.'

        I am looking forward to testing this theory in my life. I will check back in 10 years.
