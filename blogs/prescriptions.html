    <h2>The Concept of 'Prescriptions'</h2>
    <h3>9/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        I am by no means successful yet, so you probably shouldn't listen to me. But ever since the pandemic started, I have 
        been asking myself, "how do I live life?" Growing up I watched a lot of Youtube tutorials. I used to make 
        stop-motion animations, which involved taking photos. I learned from other Youtubers that taught you how to make them. 
        I was always looking for How To's. In my early 20's I wondered if there a "How to" on how to live life? Like I did for learning
        stop motion animation, I looked toward the internet for my answers. This is why I think I stumbled upon Gary Varynerchuck, then Naval Ravikant, and even the physicist David Deutsch.
        Most recently I stumbled upon Kapil Gupta.

        When I first read <a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com">Kapil Gupta's</a> philosophy, I couldn't understand what he was getting at. 
        He seemed like he was trying to sound esoteric just for the sake of it or for attracting dumb clients. 
        I decided to revisit his works, and I think his theory about what he calls 'prescriptions' is a powerful concept. It might be the most important concept to realze in this time we are living in.
        Prescriptions are simple solutions to problems in life, often something you think you have to do. Or it could be something you do because it was 
        programmed into you earlier in life and you didn't have the chance to really think about it depth yet. 
        Some examples include 'work-hard', 'get your masters degree', 'network with people', 'follow your dreams', or 'don't quit your day job'.  
        Prescriptions are dangerous because they can lead to fixate on them without asking 'why?'
        I don't think you are supposed to think to yourself, 'okay, I need to work hard' or 'okay, I need to slave away in my 20's.'  
        I don't think this will lead to true success. It is not fun either. Who likes to follow instructions or some annoying voice constnantly poking yourself telling you do something?
        By fun, I don't just mean partying all the time, I mean something more nuanced, something that has to do with following your interests and doing work you are meant to do. 
        I just don't think Elon Musk or Tom Brady or the Buddha were forcing themselves to follow some prescription. 
        I love Tom Brady and he brought my town many championships growing up, but when he sounds tough and does all that, that only works because 
        he loves Football man. All the GOATS you know are following their unique interests.

        I was following the classic "go to school for 18 years, go to higher education, and get a nice paying stable job" prescription.   
        You certainly can live this way - it doesn't break the laws of physics to live this way. But by taking this life path for granted, I felt something was missing in my life. 
        In the back of my head, I was thinking, "why am I doing this?" and "is this the only way to live?" 
        I realized the prescription was replacing my genuine desires and curiosities. 
        Since the pandemic, I started to question everything which has lead me down the paths of entrepreneurship, philosophy, science, and even love. 
        I just wanted to understand for myself how everything works. I feel like my life has been slowly improving since I started to take no ones word for it, i.e. follow a prescription. 
        It has been really hard to do this only because there is social pressure to conform and avoid pursuing the truth.

        Another way to put the idea of prescriptions is that a prescription is a 'outward to inward' way to live live: you are blindly following some glib instruction.
        I think life should be lived 'inner to outer' way to live. You are following you genuine desires.

        Looking forward to testing this theory in my life. I will check back in 10 years.
