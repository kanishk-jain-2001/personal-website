    <h2>The Concept of 'Prescriptions'</h2>
    <h3>9/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        I am by no means successful yet, so you probably shouldn't listen to me. But ever since the coronavirus pandemic, I started 
        asking myself, "how do I live the best life possible?" Growing up, I watched a lot of Youtube, and I used to make 
        stop-motion animations with Legos. I learned from other Youtubers who made videos teaching how to make them. 
        I developed this idea that there is a "how to" for everything. So I assumed that somewhere there was also a "how to" on how to live life. Like I did for learning
        stop motion animation, I looked toward Youtube and internet for my answers to life's deepest questions. This is how I stumbled upon Gary Varynerchuck, then Naval Ravikant, and even the works of physicist David Deutsch. 
        All these guys are successful in their domains and shaped my worldview about how to live a good life. They are all people whose content I recommend consuming. 
        But even though in hindsight, I learned a lot from them, I didn't amass any life experience, didn't know when necessarily to apply their teachings, if their teachings were even right, and I still did not know what to do with my life. So, I kept living life. I moved to the Bay Area and I worked for various start-ups. 
        I kept thinking, writing, reading, and searching. I eventually stumbled upon Kapil Gupta's works.

        When I first read <a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com">Kapil Gupta's</a> philosophy, I couldn't understand what he was getting at. 
        He seemed like he was trying to sound esoteric just for the sake of it and was trying to attract dumb clients. 
        I decided to revisit his writings recently, and now I think his theory about what he calls 'prescriptions' answers the doubts I had on how to live life.  
        The TLDR is no 'how to' on how to live a good life. Prescriptions are proposed solutions to problems in life, often something you think you have to do. 
        Or it could be something you do because it was programmed into you earlier in life and you didn't have the chance to really evaluate it for yourself. 
        Some examples include 'work-hard', 'get a degree', 'network with people', 'follow your dreams', or 'don't quit your day job'.
        It could even be Naval's 'How to get rich' tweet storm or anything you heard your favorite influencers say. 
        Prescriptions are dangerous because they can lead to fixate on them without asking 'why?'  
        Folllowing prescriptions will not lead to a well-lived life and they are not fun. Who likes to follow instructions?
        By fun, I don't just mean partying all the time, I mean something more nuanced, something that has to do with following your interests and doing work you are meant to do. 
        I just don't think Elon Musk or Tom Brady or the Buddha were forcing themselves to follow some prescription. 
        I respect Tom Brady and he brought my town many championships growing up, but I think he was successful because he loved football. 
        All the GOATS seem to be following their unique interests and not following any 'how to's.'

        I was following the classic "go to school for 18 years, go to higher education, and get a nice paying stable job" prescription.   
        You certainly can live this way - it doesn't break the laws of physics to live this way. But by taking this life path for granted, I felt something was missing in my life. 
        In the back of my head, I was thinking, "why am I doing this?" and "is this the only way to live?" 
        I realized the prescription was replacing my genuine desires and curiosities. Since the pandemic, I started to question everything which has lead me down the paths of entrepreneurship, philosophy, science, and even understanding sexual energy. 
        I just wanted to understand for myself how everything works. I feel like my life has been slowly improving since I started to take no ones word for it, i.e. following prescriptions. 
        It has been really hard to do this only because there is social pressure to conform and avoid pursuing the truth.

        Another way to put the idea of prescriptions is that a prescription is a 'outward to inward' way to live live: you are blindly following some glib instruction.
        I think life should be lived 'inner to outer' way to live. You are following you genuine desires. So, all the stuff you consume on the internet, although might be true, 
        you won't know it's true unless you lived it. You can only tell it is true from hindsight. You can probably throw away all the instructions you were given and figure things 
        out for your own. If anything, it will be a lot more fun way to live.

        Looking forward to testing this theory in my life. I will check back in 10 years.
