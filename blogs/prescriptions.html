    <h2>Kapil Gupta and the Concept of 'Prescriptions'</h2>
    <h3>9/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com">Kapil Gupta's</a> idea about 'prescriptions' is important to consider.
        Prescriptions are simple solutions to problems in life, often something you have to force yourself to do - kind of like taking medicine that your doctor prescribes you.
        Some examples include 'work-hard' or 'get your masters degree' or 'network with people.' 
        Prescriptions are dangerous because they can lead to fixate on them rather than the true goal in life - which I argue for everyone is to live a good one. 
        I don't think you are supposed to think to yourself, 'okay, I need to work hard' or 'okay, I need to slave away in my 20's.' 
        I don't think this will lead to true success. And it doesn't sound like fun either. 
        By fun, I don't just mean partying all the time, I mean something more nuanced, something that has to do with following your interests and doing work you are meant to do. 
        I just don't think Elon Musk or Tom Brady or the Buddha were forcing themselves to follow some prescription. 
        I think they were following their unique interests.

        I was following the classic "go to school for 18 years, go to higher education, and get a nice paying stable job" prescription.   
        You certainly can live this way - it doesn't break the laws of physics to live this way. 
        But by taking this life path for granted, I felt something was missing in my life. 
        In the back of my head, I was thinking, "why am I doing this?" and "is this the only way to live?" 
        I realized the prescription was replacing my genuine desires and curiosities. 
        Since the pandemic, I started to question everything which has lead me down the paths of entrepreneurship, philosophy, science, and even love. 
        I just wanted to understand for myself how everything works. I feel like my life has been slowly improving since I started to take no ones word for it, i.e. follow a prescription. 
        It has been really hard to do this only because there is social pressure to conform and avoid pursuing the truth.

        Another way to put the idea of prsciprtions is that a prescription is a 'outward to inner' way to live live. I think life should be lived 'inner to outer'
