    <h2>Kapil Gupta and the Concept of 'Prescriptions'</h2>
    <h3>9/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        At first, <a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com">Kapil Gupta</a> may come across as another guru that is just trying to get your money. 
        Look, I get it. Everyone wants to put food on the table, and the man is playing the game of capitalism like most of us out here. 
        So I wondered what would happen if I put my ego aside and tried to take his words seriously. 
        What I learned was something profound.

    <p>
        I think the essence of his philosophy has to do with what he calls a 'prescription.'
        Once you become aware of the concept of prescriptions, you notice them all over the place. 
        You may even realize that most of your life you have been chasing prescriptions in one form or another.
        What is a 'prescription?' 
        A prescription is a solution to a problem in your life given to you by an external source, whether that be Twitter, advice from 
        your elders, or something you even come up with yourself. 
        The reason why prescriptions are all over the place is that there is a massive appetite for them: people want easy solutions to their problems.

        I am not sure if Kapil would go this far, but I would say prescriptions are the most dangerous thing in the world.
        They can easily lead to a wasted life, and as Kapil says, a life is a terrible thing to waste. 
        What is the biggest prescription of them all? I think it is the classic "go to school for 18 years, go to higher education, get a job, marry, work a job until age 65, retire." 
        I think people are slowly starting to wake up and realize that life is not meant to be lived in this way. 
        Look there is nothing 'bad' about it; if your life has been lived that way, then it has been lived that way. 
        Prescriptions can be starting points, school can be great place to start. Your first job can be a great place to start. 
        But if you want to squeeze the essence out of your life and life the best life possible, I don't think you can solely rely on them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I think every human being can be great. But the way you get there is not by following a prescription. 
        It's by listening to yourself. Truth is something no one can impart on you. You have to follow your gut. You have to make 
        mistakes. There seems to be no other way. 
        It's really hard to do this only becuase the pressure to conform to society is insane. We also seem to have an inner biological tendency to avoid
        going against the grain of other people's wishes.  
    </p>
    <p>
        We have this notion that you need to 'work-hard' or keep pushing yourself or to do things even when you don't feel like it. 
        I would like to take the completely opposite view. No 'force' is needed. 
       I feel we judge ourselves so much. We judge outselves for procrastinating and for not focusing. Follow your own curiosity and let the world around you prosper. 
       Your success does depend on you: but only your ability to get out of your own way.
