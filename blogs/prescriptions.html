    <h2>My thoughts on Kapil Gupta's Philosophy</h2>
    <h3>9/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        At first, I thought <a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com">Kapil Gupta</a> is some fraudulent guru. 
        I then wondered what would happen if I put my ego aside and tried to take his words seriously. What I learned was something profound.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think the essense of Kapil's philosphy has to do with an idea that he calls 'prescriptions'
        Once you become aware of the concept of prescriptions, you notice them all over the place. 
        What are 'prescriptions?' There is a massive appetite for them. People want solutions to their problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        These prescriptions can be starting points. But solely relyig on them to make you get to some place is not going to work. A "How-To" is too superficial.
        The full truth is more than just a glib 'how-to' can provide. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I think every human being can be great. But the way you get there is not by emulating other people. It's by listening to yourself. It's really hard to do this. 
        We have this notion that you need to 'work-hard' or keep pushing yourself or to do things even when you don't feel like it. I would like to take the completely 
        opposite view. 
    </p>
    <p>
       I feel the only way to be 'great' is to allow yourself to blossum. We judge ourselves so much out here. Why am I feeling like doing one thing rather than
       another. Follow your own curiosity and let the world around you prosper. In a way this is an arguement against free will. Your success does depend on you: but only
       your ability to get out of your own way.
