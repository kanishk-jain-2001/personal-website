    <h2>'Prescriptions' and what to do with your life</h2>
    <h3>9/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        I am by no means successful yet, so you probably shouldn't listen to me. But ever since the coronavirus pandemic, I started 
        asking myself, "how do I live the best life possible?" The pandemic allowed me to go deep on this question because of the free time it gave me. 
        To answer this question, I looked towards the internet. This is how I stumbled upon Gary Varynerchuck, then Naval Ravikant, and even the works of physicist David Deutsch. 
        All of them are successful in their domains and talk a lot about business, life, and scientific philosophy. 
        But even though I thought I learned a lot from them, I didn't know when necessarily to apply their teachings, and I still did not know what to do with my life. 
        So, I kept going. I moved to the Bay Area and I worked for various start-ups. 
        I kept thinking, writing, reading, and searching on the side. I eventually stumbled upon Kapil Gupta's works.

        When I first read <a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com">Kapil Gupta's</a> philosophy, I couldn't understand what he was saying. 
        He seemed like he was trying to sound esoteric just for the sake of it and was trying to attract dumb clients. 
        I decided to revisit his writings recently, and now I think his theory about what he calls 'prescriptions' puts light into the question of how to live a good life.
        And the answer is that there is no "How to" for that. Prescriptions are well intentioned but they don't work. Unfortunately, they are everywhere. 
        Some examples include 'work-hard', 'get a degree', 'network with people.' It could even be Naval's 'How to get rich' tweet storm. 
        Prescriptions are dangerous because they can lead to fixate on them without asking 'why?'  
        Folllowing prescriptions are not even fun. Who likes to follow instructions?
        By fun, I don't just mean partying all the time, I mean something more nuanced, something that has to do with following your interests and doing work you are meant to do. 
        I just don't think Gary V, Naval, or David Deutsch were forcing themselves to follow some prescription. 
        All the truly successful people seem to be following their unique interests and not following any 'how to's.'

        I was following the classic "go to school for 18 years, go to higher education, and get a nice paying stable job" prescription.   
        You certainly can live this way - it doesn't break the laws of physics to live this way. But by taking this life path for granted, I felt something was missing in my life. 
        In the back of my head, I was thinking, "why am I doing this?" and "is this the only way to live?" 
        I realized the prescription was replacing my genuine desires and curiosities. Since the pandemic, I started to question everything which has lead me down the paths of entrepreneurship, philosophy, science, and even understanding sexual energy. 
        I just wanted to understand for myself how everything works. I feel like my life has been slowly improving since I started to take no ones word for it, i.e. following prescriptions. 
        It has been really hard to do this only because there is social pressure to conform and avoid pursuing the truth.

        Another way to put the idea of prescriptions is that a prescription is a 'outward to inward' way to live live. You come up with something in your head or you see
        other people doing it, and you try to live your life that way. It doesn't work. 
        I think life should be lived in an 'inner to outer' way by following your genuine desires. How does this work in practice? I think it has to do with 
        having free time and being alone and thinking. I am wary to write that because it sounds like a prescription. But I think that you should figure everything out 
        for your own. Take no ones word for it.

        Looking forward to testing this theory in my life. I will check back in 10 years.

    <p><strong>TLDR: look inward, not outward.</strong></p>
