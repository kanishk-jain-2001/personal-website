    <h2>Kapil Gupta and the Concept of 'Prescriptions'</h2>
    <h3>9/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        At first, <a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com">Kapil Gupta</a> may come across as another guru that is just trying to get your money. 
        Look, everyone wants to put food on the table, and the man is playing the game of capitalism like most of us out here. 
        I wondered what would happen if I put my ego aside and tried to take his words seriously. 
        What I learned was something profound.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think the essense of his philosphy has to do with what he calls a 'prescription.'
        Once you become aware of the concept of prescriptions, you notice them all over the place. 
        You may even realize that most of your life you have been chasing prescriptions in one form or another.
        What are 'prescriptions?' 

        There is a massive appetite for them. People want solutions to their problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Presciptions can be starting points. 
        But solely relyig on them to make you get to some place is not going to work. 
        A "Prescription" is too superficial.
        The full truth is more than just a glib "Prscription" can provide. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I think every human being can be great. 
        But the way you get there is not by following a prescription. 
        It's by listening to yourself. 
        It's really hard to do this only becuase most of us have been conditioned by society in one form of another.
        We have this notion that you need to 'work-hard' or keep pushing yourself or to do things even when you don't feel like it. 
        I would like to take the completely opposite view. 
        No 'force' is needed. 
    </p>
    <p>
       I feel the only way to be 'great' is to allow yourself to blossum. We judge ourselves so much out here. Why am I feeling like doing one thing rather than
       another. Follow your own curiosity and let the world around you prosper. In a way this is an arguement against free will. Your success does depend on you: but only
       your ability to get out of your own way.
