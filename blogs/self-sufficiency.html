    <h2>The Self-Sufficient Human: An Ideal Way To Live</h2>
    <h3>10/16/24</h3>
    <p>
        The knowledge needed for us survive in the modern day is much different than the knowledge we needed in the past. 
        Long ago, each human had the knowledge needed to survive on their own in the wild. They knew which plants to eat and how to hunt. 
        A stable food supply was not as guaranteed as it is today, but we used to be self-sufficient.
        As soon as civilization began, the knowledge needed to survive diversified, requiring humans to work together. 
        Just a few people (farmers), could grow food for entire cities. What was the rest of society going to do?
        People started to specialize with the goal providing goods and services others may need in return for money. This is Adam Smith's invisable hand. 
        Out sprung professions such as craftsman, artisans, scientists, writers, and entrepreneurs. 
        This has led to massive abundance and growth of our knowledge. It has also closed wealth gap, despite what people may say: I have the same iPhone as Elon Musk. 
        This progress - although amazing  - has brought forth a new problem that must be addressed: it is unnecessarily hard to get to the point 
        where contributing to the free market comes naturally and is fun to you.

        Making a business is hard because finding what people need involves trial and error. That's fine. It is fun. 
        The issue is that they don't teach us this in school. They told us that if we do what we are told, then we will be set and will be able to contribute to the market. 
        How did that work out for us Gen Z kids? I just completed 18 years of school + 4 years of higher education, did all the standardized tests and all the internships.
        I still can't get an engineering job. It's a skill issue. I am not skilled enough and studied an esoteric field (chemical engineering). 
        I currently using my time to learn programming, write. I am also building businesses. 
        But I could have started this process much earlier if they just told me this is how the free market works. Time was wasted following prescriptions.

    <p>
        I write this to not complain, but to propose a solution so that our kids don't have to go through this BS. 
        I am not advocating for socialism or communism. I love freedom. 
        I envision a world where we can be self-sufficient again though the help of technology. 
        Imagine if your town was a city-state that had it's own nuclear reactor, army of worker robots, automated transportation systems, and automated farms. 
        Imagine if you didn't have to go to work and you could use your free-time to do things you wanted to do, instead of waste time listening to obsolete paths society tells you to traverse. 
        I don't want us to be lazy bums. I envision us to all have the knowledge of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. 
        I want to get there. I want to help us get there. It might not happen in my lifetime, but the process of getting there for me will be fun. 
        I may also get wealthy in the process if I succeed on just one aspect of it. 
        This is why I want to work for a technological start-up or create my own company that can help make abundance for the world.
