    <h2>The Self-Sufficient Human: An Ideal Way To Live</h2>
    <h3>10/XX/24</h3>
    <p>
        At first humans used to be self-suffieicnt. Each human had the knowledge needed to survive in their 
        environment. Now, humans are interdependant. There is no way I can survive without other people growing my 
        food, providing heating to my house. It just feels bad. This also makes me a slave to capitialism. Now I have 
        to figure out a way to help other people out. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I envision a world where we can be self-sufficient again though the help of technology. Imagine if your town / 
        neighborhood had it's own nuclear reactor, army of worker robots, transportation systems, and automated farms. 
        Imagine if you didn't have to go to work and you could use your free-time to do things you wanted to do. I want
        to get there. I want to help us get there. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It might not happen in my lifetime, but the process of getting there for me will be fun. I may also get wealthy in 
        the process if I succeed on just one aspect of it. But yes, essentially that is the future I envision. I want to work 
        for a technological start-up that can help make abundance for the world.
