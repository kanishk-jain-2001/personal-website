    <h2>The Self-Sufficient Human: An Ideal Way To Live</h2>
    <h3>10/16/24</h3>

        The knowledge that previous generations needed to survive is much different than we need to survive in the modern day. 
        In the hunter gatherer past, each human had the knowledge needed to survive on their own in the wild. 
        They knew which plants to eat and how to hunt. They were trained to do this since they were born and what worked for their parents worked for them.  
        Today, I can't get a job even after society trained me for 18 years + 4 years of attaining an engineering degree.
        Imagine a 23 year old man in a hunter gatherer tribe that couldn't provide. Although society is much safer, we have more amenities, and I can get a 
        minimum wage job, I feel like the purpose of education was defeated in my life.

        So what went wrong? I don't want to knock on the modern day. I think we are living in massive wealth compared to people in the past.
        It's just that we are going through some growing pains. To survive in the modern day, we need to be able to contribute to the free market. 
        We are  much more dependant on other humans for survival. And I need to play the game of capitalism in order to provide 
        me stuff that I really want - food, a home, some clothes, a car, and a decent environment. I don't want to knock on capitalism because
        I love freedom and the only other option is socialism. I cannot survive today without other people growing my 
        food, providing heating to my house. However, I think interdependance, is ultimately weakness and restricts my freedom.

        I envision a world where we can be self-sufficient again though the help of technology. Imagine if your 
        town was a city-state that had it's own nuclear reactor, army of worker robots, automated transportation systems, and automated farms. 
        Imagine if you didn't have to go to work and you could use your free-time to do things you wanted to do, instead of waste time listening to obsolete paths society tells you to traverse. 
        I want to get there. I want to help us get there. It might not happen in my lifetime, but the process of getting there for me will be fun. I may also get wealthy in the process if I succeed on just one aspect of it. 
        This is why I want to work for a technological start-up or create my own company that can help make abundance for the world.
