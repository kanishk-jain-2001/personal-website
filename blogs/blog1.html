    <h2>My thoughts on Kapil Gupta's Philosophy</h2>
    <h3>9/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com">Kapil Gupta MD</a> is some dude that I first came across on the internet maybe a few years ago, I think through the Twitter algorithm.
         At first, his viewpoints and his brand were esoteric to me. He also comes across as a dude that is trying to sound enlightened. And I get it. It may helps 
         be part of his brand. After putting my ego aside and try to take his thoughts seriously, I started to finally see the truth at what he was getting at.

    <p>
        He talks about a state with no "how-to's." How do I become rich, how do 
    </p>
    <p>
        How to's are great starting points. But solely relyig on them to make you get to some place is not going to work. A "How-To" is too superficial.
