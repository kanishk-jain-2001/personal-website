    <h2>My thoughts on Kapil Gupta's Philosophy</h2>
    <h3>9/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        At first, <a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com">Kapil Gupta MD</a> may come across as some fraudulent guru 
        that is trying to sound like he has all the answers. Then I wondered what would happen if I put my ego aside and
        and tried to take his words seriously. What I learned was something profound and something that was actually on 
        the back of my mind for some time.

        Kapil talks about a phenomena that he calls 'prescriptions'
        Once you become aware of the concept of these prescriptions, you notice them all over the place. 
        There is a massive appetite for them. People want solutions to their problems.

        How to's can be starting points. But solely relyig on them to make you get to some place is not going to work. A "How-To" is too superficial.
        The full truth is more than just a glib 'how-to' can provide
    </p>

        I think every human being can be great. But the way you get there is not by emulating other people. It's by listening to yourself. It's really hard to do this. 
        We have this notion that you need to 'work-hard' or keep pushing yourself or to do things even when you don't feel like it. I would like to take the completely 
        opposite view.

       I feel the only way to be 'great' is to allow yourself to blossum. We judge ourselves so much out here. Why am I feeling like doing one thing rather than
       another. Follow your own curiosity and let the world around you prosper.
