    <h2>My thoughts on Kapil Gupta's Philosophy</h2>
    <h3>9/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        At first, <a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com">Kapil Gupta MD</a> may come across as some fraudulent guru 
        that is trying to sound like he has all the answers  . That's what I thought. 
    </p>

        He talks about a state with no "how-to's." Once you become aware of the concept of 'how-to's, the world seems indundated with them. 
        There is a massive appetite for them. People want solutions to their problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        How to's can be starting points. But solely relyig on them to make you get to some place is not going to work. A "How-To" is too superficial.
        The full truth is more than just a glib 'how-to' can provide
    </p>
    <p>
        I think every human being can be great. But the way you get there is not by emulating other people. It's by listening to yourself. It's really hard to do this. 
        We have this notion that you need to 'work-hard' or keep pushing yourself or to do things even when you don't feel like it. I would like to take the completely 
        opposite view.
