    <h2>What is the purpose of the internet?</h2>
    <h3>10/6/24</h3>
    <p>
        As a Gen-Z dude, I don't remember a time without the internet or computers. My early 20's has been about understanding the world around me and how 
        all this technology came to be. One question I have been asking myself is "what is the purpose of the internet and what I even doing on it?" 
        My initial response was vague; the internet allows me to network with people and to learn things. 
        But this answer led me to further questions: why do I need the internet to network with people or why couldn't I just go to the local library to learn things? 
        What does the internet uniquely provide me? This blog post attempts to get at a satisfying answer.

        I think it There are two things: 
        <ul>
            <li>It is fun</li>
            <li>It is the most helpful tool in the world</li>
        </ul>

        It is fun. Video Games, Memes, Social Interactions. There are Memes. But I think these just scratch the surface. 
        The most fun part about the internet is making stuff for other people. The most fun part about the internet is that you can create and share things. 
        For example, there is something diffrent about writing on this blog versus writing in a personal journal, even if no one ends up reading it. 
        I have skin in the game here. It is forcing me to put my best ideas forth. The process of doing this is fun. It feels like doing 
        art. It feels like I am doing it for it's own sake. Even though I am not sure I think about it conciosutly before writing, there
        are side effects that I think this has. it allows me to project to the world my viewpoints. Something I write may resonate with someone else and we could become business partners. 
        Talented people are what is going to make the world a better place. If we want a future of abundance, I don't think any one person will be able to do it. Even with AI, you can create a 1 person billino 
        dollar company, but that company would still have to deal with others. 
    </p>
    <h4> What are the drawbacks?</h4>
    <p>
        We are still at the point where our lives are split between the digital world and the 'real' world. I put real 
        in quotations because, David Deutsch calls everything virtual reality; your senses are rendering a environment for you, and
        you are never getting the 'whole' reality. But the point remains - there is a bifurcation of worlds and this poses a problem because 
        if you are completely immersed in the internet, you are going to eventually suffer. Your family is counting on you to provide for them. 
        Your body is counting on you to exercise. You can't spend all day on the internet currently without consequences. 
        In the future, we may be able to transfer our consciousness or something into a digitial world, but we are not there yet. 
        The unfortunte truth is that the Internet has infinite variation. It is infinitely addicting. It has the potential to 
        put you into a loop that you may not be able to get out of. Sports betting, social media, porn. This stuff could hook you forever
        and then fuck up your life in the real world.

        So the internet is very much a double edged sword. How do you navigate it? I don't think I can give you an answer. This may be something
        you have to figrue out for yourself. Be careful out there. I think it helps to consume people that your gut tells you are genuine. 
        For me that is Gary V and Naval Ravikant. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Human beings are universal explainers. Although we are not born with all the knowledge that will be useful to have in life,
        we have the ability to learn anything about this universe if we want. This knowledge on the 
        internet was found without the help of the internet. But the internet accelerates the time it can take for a human to 
        get up to speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The internet makes life much easier and makes success attainable to everyone. This is because there are genuine people 
        on it that out of their conviction want to help others. Naval Ravikant and Gary Vaynerchuck are two good examples of 
        this. Consuming their content has changed the software in my brain to become a more positive sum thinker. I just want to 
        help create wealth for the world now. That is my vision. I want to live in massive abundance. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Growing up in the age of the internet - although it did have drawbacks which I won't go into - has had 
        many positive impacts on me. For example, it has exposed me to great people like Naval Ravikant, David 
        Deutsch, Gary Vaynurchuck. They helped me change the software in my brain and give me direction on to where I want 
        to take life. What other purposes are there of the internet? It is a networking tool that helps you connect to other humans. Why 
        do you want to connect to other humans? Well, if those humans have a lot of knoweldge, you can learn from them. 
        If you are in a dire pinch, other humans can help you out. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The internet is not necessary. You don't have to use the internet. In fact, if it is not fun for you, then don't use it. 
        For me, writing is fun. Sharing ideas with others is fun. Potentially finding future business partners is fun. 
        I am someone that wants to improve the world through technology. 
        I want to make abundance for the world. This requires other people's permission. The internet will help me reach out to other people.
