    <h2>What is the purpose of the internet?</h2>
    <h3>10/6/24</h3>
    <p>
        As a Gen Z dude, I don't remember a time without internet, and I have taken the technology for granted until now. 
        What even is the purpose of the internet and what I even doing on it? 
        My initial response was that the internet allows me to network with people and to learn things. 
        But this answer led me to further questions: why do I need the internet to network with people and why can't I just go to the local library to learn things? 
        What does the internet uniquely provide me? This blog post attempts to get at a satisfying answer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think this is the answer: The internet allows you to <strong>Learn, Create, Socialize, and Share</strong> with the most convenience. 
        It's like any effective technology. A hammer allows you to easily nail a nail. The internet allows you more easily achieve those four goals.  
    </p>

        In the past, if I wanted to learn something, I would have had to go to centralized places such as universities and libraries. Today I can use Youtube, OpenCourseWare, and online textbooks. 
        In the past, if I wanted to spread ideas, I would have had to use the printing press or give a speech to a live audience. Today I can write tweets and record podcasts.
        In the past, if I wanted to know what was going on in the world, I would have had to refer to centralized newspapers or word of mouth. Today, I can see what's trending on X. 
        In the past, if I wanted to sell something, I would have had to go to a public market. Today, I can market organically on social media and sell on etsy and amazon. 
        In the past, if I wanted to find a mate or even just socialize, I would have had to physically go out. Today, I have dating apps and social media. I think this is one area where the internet doesn't work so well. 
        In all these examples, our motivation is the same as the past: Learn, Create, Socialize, and Share. 
        The convenience is what makes internet preferable over the past alternatives to achieve these goals.

    <h4> What are the drawbacks of the internet?</h4>
    <p>
        We are still at the point where our lives are split between the digital world and the 'real' world. I put real 
        in quotations because, David Deutsch calls everything virtual reality; your senses are rendering a environment for you like your computer 
        renders a video game environment. But the point remains - there is a bifurcation of worlds and this poses a problem because 
        if you are completely immersed in the internet, your life in the real world will suffer. Your family is counting on you to provide for them. 
        Your body is counting on you to exercise. You can't spend all day on the internet currently without consequences. 
        In the future, we may be able to transfer our consciousness or something like that into a digitial world, but we are not there yet. 
        The unfortunate truth is that the internet has infinite variation. It is infinitely addicting. It has the potential to 
        put you into a loop that you may not be able to get out of. Sports betting, social media, porn. This stuff could hook you forever
        and then negatively affect your life in the real world. 
    </p>

        So the internet is very much a double edged sword. How should one navigate it? I think it helps to consume people that your gut tells you are genuine. On Twitter, there are a lot of high quality people that you can interact with. 
        I think it's important to be self-aware and take a break from it if it no longer is fun or fruitful. It also makes sense to share only your genuine and truthful self. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, the internet makes life easier. There are genuine people on it that out of their conviction want to help others. 
        Naval Ravikant and Gary Vaynerchuck are two good examples of this. Consuming their content has changed the software in my brain to become a more positive sum thinker. 
        I just want to help create wealth for the world now. That is my vision. I want to live in massive abundance. But the internet accelerates the time it can take for a human to 
        get up to speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The internet is not necessary. You don't have to use the internet. The universe will still do it's thing whether or not you are. 
        For me, writing this is fun. Seeing SpaceX's successful Startship launch today was fun. Learning from others is fun. 
        For now, I will keep building on the internet. Looking forward to the future.
