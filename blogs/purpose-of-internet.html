    <h2>What is the purpose of the internet? Why am I even writing this blog?</h2>

        I asked myself a few days ago, "what is the purpose of the internet and what I even doing on it?" 
        My initial response was vague; the internet allows me to network with people and to learn things. 
        But this answer led me to further questions: why do I need the internet to network
        with people or why couldn't I just go to the local library to learn things? What does the internet uniquely provide me? 
        This blog post attempts to get at a satisfying answer.
        
        On the internet, an individual is able to own things. I have a personal website. I have a twitter, linkedin, and instagram account. Not to mention accounts 
        to handle finances. I don't really want to own things - I would rather be free. But the 
        What even is the purpose of this? Why am I even writing a blog?  I think the biggest reason is that it is fun to write. Something about writing down your thoughts (when you are not forcing it) 
        is just fun to do. People say that writing also helps you become more articulate. That's great, but 
        just process of writing is just fun. It's something I am compelled to do without any reason. I guess it has 
        to do with the genuine desire to share things with others. Something about it feels more official than writing in just a 
        personal journal. Could it be there is more accountability, which forces me to have better ideas?

        Growing up in the age of the internet - although it did have drawbacks which I won't go into - has had 
        many positive impacts on me. For example, it has exposed me to great people like Naval Ravikant, David 
        Deutsch, Gary Vaynurchuck. They helped me change the software in my brain and give me direction on to where I want 
        to take life. What other purposes are there of the internet? It is a networking tool that helps you connect to other humans. Why 
        do you want to connect to other humans? Well, if those humans have a lot of knoweldge, you can learn from them. 
        If you are in a dire pinch, other humans can help you out.

        The internet is not necessary. You don't have to use the internet. I am someone that wants to improve the world through
        technology. I want to make abundance for the world. This requires other people's permission. The internet will help me 
        reach out to other people.

        My answer, and I am not sure if this applies to everyone, is that writing on the interent allows me to take accountability. 
        There is something official about writing on this blog versus writing in a personal journal. I have skin in the game here, even
        if no one ends up reading it. It is forcing me to put my best ideas forth. The process of doing this is fun. It feels like doing 
        art. It feels like I am doing it for it's own sake. But there is also other things that it allows me to do, it allows me to 
        project people of similiar viewpoints. At the end of the day, talented people are what is going to make the world a better place. 
        If we want a future of abundance, I don't think any one person will be able to do it. Even with AI, you can create a 1 person billino 
        dollar copmanu, but that company would still have to deal with others.
