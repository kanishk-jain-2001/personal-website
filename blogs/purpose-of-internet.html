    <h2>What is the purpose of the internet?</h2>
    <h3>10/6/24</h3>
    <p>
        As a Gen Z dude, I don't remember a time without internet, and I have taken the technology for granted until now. 
        What even is the purpose of the internet and what I even doing on it? 
        My initial response was that the internet allows me to network with people and to learn things. 
        But this answer led me to further questions: why do I need the internet to network with people and why can't I just go to the local library to learn things? 
        What does the internet uniquely provide me? This blog post attempts to get at a satisfying answer.
    </p>

        I think the answer is that the internet allows you to <strong>Consume</strong> and <strong>Share</strong> information with the most convenience and without permission. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the past, if I wanted to explore a new topic, I would have had to go to centralized institutions such as universities and libraries. Today I can use Youtube, OpenCourseWare, and online textbooks. 
        In the past, if I wanted to spread ideas, I would have had to use the printing press or give a speech to a live audience. Today I can write blog posts and record podcasts.
        In the past, if I wanted to know what was going on in the world, I would have had to rely on newspapers or word of mouth. Today, I can see what's trending on X.  
        In the past, if I wanted to sell something, I would have had to go to a public market and find a physical place to set up shop. Today, I can market organically on social media and sell on Etsy and Amazon. 
        In the past, if I wanted to find a mate or even just socialize, I would have had to physically go out. Today, I have dating apps and social media. (I think this is one area where the internet doesn't work so well and IRL interactions may be necessary)
        In all these examples, our motivation is the same as the past: to either Consume or Share information. The convenience and permissionless nature is what makes internet preferable over the past alternatives.

    <h4>Okay, the internet is convenient. What are the drawbacks?</h4>
    <p>
        We are still at the point where our lives are split between the digital world and the real world. This dichotomy poses a problem because 
        if you spend all of your time on the internet, your life in the real world will suffer. 
        Your family is counting on you to provide for them. Your body is counting on you to exercise. You can't spend all day on the internet currently without consequences. 
        In the future, we may be able to transfer our consciousness or something like that into a digital world, but we are not there yet. 
        The unfortunate truth is that the internet is an addicting drug. The internet has infinite variation and it can overwhelm your brain. It has the potential to 
        put you into a loop that is hard to get out of. Clickbait News, Social Media, Pornography - this stuff could hooks you
        and negatively affects your life in the real world. I have admittedly fallen victim, and I can say that it has the effect of dulling your life satisfaction in the real world. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So the internet seems like a double edged sword. How should one navigate it? I think to some extent you have to get addicted and experience the negative aspects of it first hand before 
        you can develep a relationship with it that works for you. I learned that it helps to consume content from people that your gut tells you are genuine. On Twitter, there are a lot of high quality people that you can interact with. 
        I think it's important to be self-aware and take a break from it if it no longer is fun or fruitful. It also makes sense to share only your genuine and truthful self. 
        I think is undeniable that internet makes life easier, and shouldn't be cut out completely. There are genuine people on it that out of their own conviction want to help others. 
        Naval Ravikant and Gary Vaynerchuck are two good examples of this. Consuming their content has changed the software in my brain to become a more positive sum thinker. 
        I may never have developed this mindset if it wasn't for the internet allowing me to 'meet' Gary and Naval.   
    </p>
    <p>
        The internet is not necessary. You don't have to use the internet. The world will still go on with or without you being plugged in. 
        For me, writing this is fun. Seeing SpaceX's successful Startship launch today was fun. Learning from others is fun. 
        This is because 'Consuming' and 'Sharing' are natural and innate activities for us. The internet enables us 
        to do those activities without permission. That is why I will stay connected.
