    <h2>What is the purpose of the internet? Why am I even writing this blog?</h2>

        I asked myself the other day, what am I even doing on the internet? I have a personal website. I have a twitter, 
        linkedin, and instagram account. What even is the purpose of this? Why am I even writing a blog?

        I think the biggest rason is that it is fun to write. Something about writing down your thoughts (when you are not forcing it) 
        is just fun to do. People say that writing also helps you become more articulate. That's great, but 
        just process of writing is just fun. It's something I am compelled to do without any reason. I guess it has 
        to do with the genuine desire to share things with others. Something about it feels more official.

        Growing up in the age of the internet - although it did have drawbacks which I won't go into - has had 
        many positive impacts on me. For example, it has exposed me to great people like Naval Ravikant, David 
        Deutsch, Gary Vaynurchuck. They helped me change the software in my brain and give me direction on to where I want 
        to take life.

        What other purposes are there of the internet? It is a networking tool that helps you connect to other humans. Why 
        do you want to connect to other humans? Well, if those humans have a lot of knoweldge, you can learn from them.
